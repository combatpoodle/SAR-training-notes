* Primary assessment
* Patient history
* Medical/trauma assessment
* Periodic reassessment

## Scene Size-Up
* scene safety
* bsi/gloves
* mechanism of injury/nature of illness

	* Bleeding/pressure/tourniquet
* *missed*

## Patient History
* S *signs and symtpoms*
* A *allergies*
* M *medications*
* P *past medical history*
* L *last oral intake*

## Medical/Trauma Assessment: OPQRST
* O *Onset*
* P *Provocation and palliation*
* Q *Quality*
* R *Region/Radiation*

###  Focused assessment/body scan

###  Trauma Assessment: DCAPBTLS

## Obvious signs of death (dependent lividity)
* Obvious deformity/injuries not compatible with life
* Putrefaction
* Blood pooling
* Rigor Mortis (stiffness)

# Simplified
Look at them, talk to them, etc

REPLACE defective (airway, pulse, splint, etc)

Categorize to sick/not
